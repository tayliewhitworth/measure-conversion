# Measure Conversion

## About project

This mini project is a measure convertor. I used HTML as the base layout and then added in Javascript functions to create a measurement conversion. I used CSS to style the page like the figma design that was given to me. In the javascript I created an addEventListener() to activate the conversion when the button was clicked. The function takes the input value and converts it into three different metrics.

Super simple and easy project for beginning in javascript!
